# simple-modelling

This is project is an enhanced copy of the [simple-site](https://github.com/jpadfield/simple-site) repository. It has been set up to provide a dedicated example of using the system to generate flow diagrams to presentsemantic modelling examples. The initial examples primarily focus on the [CIDOC CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/), but will be extended to cover other ontologies and standards, such as [Linked.Art](https://linked.art/), as further work is done.

### To see the example web pages got to: [simple-modelling](https://jpadfield.github.io/simple-modelling/).
